## How to use a Price List

Price Lists will be used when creating [Item Prices](/entries/item-price) to keep 
track of the selling or buying price of an Item.

**Disable a Price List**: Uncheck the `Enabled` checkbox to make the selected Price List Inactive. Disabled 
Price List will not be visible in the Sales and Purchase transactions.

**Price Not UOM Dependent**: Take tomatoes as an example, which you may buy in boxes 
and sell in kilograms. 10 kilograms equal 1 box, and the cost of 1 kilogram is 10 rupees. 
If you just choose one box in your transaction and this field Price Not UOM Dependent is 
left unchecked, the price will only be displayed for a Kilo because that is the only item 
price that has been kept. Now, if you check this box and conduct a transaction with a box 
of tomatoes, the price will be set to 100 because the cost of 1 box (10 kilos) is 100.

## Features

### 1. Unit of Measurement (UOM)

If an item is sold in multiple UOMs, users can add UOM-specific item prices. 
For example, if an item of Rice is sold in 1 KG and 500-gram packets, users can 
specify the UOM in the item prices, and the item price will be calculated depending 
on the UOM selected in the transaction.

### 2. Applying Price List to a specific Customer/Supplier

If you choose a customer from the Party field, you can only apply this Item Price 
only to that particular customer.

### 3. Applying Price List to a specific Batch

You can also link a specific batch to an Item Price, and when that batch is selected 
in the transaction, the item price for that specific batch will be applied.

### 4. Validity

You can specify the Valid From date to the date when the Item Price is applicable, and
 you can also set the Valid Upto date to the day when the Item Price will expire.

### 5. Status

It indicates whether the Item Price is Enabled, Disabled or Expired.
